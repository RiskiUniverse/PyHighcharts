## Overview

PyHighcharts has changed!

The older version of the code is still available at: [PyHighcharts v1.0](https://github.com/fidyeates/PyHighcharts/tree/branch1.0)

This overhaul is intended to make the invocation of the PyHighcharts wrapper more pythonesque and allow for more modular functionality and better integration with web frameworks.

## Installation

The easiest way to get pyhighcharts would be via PyPi

    sudo pip install PyHighcharts

Alternatively you can clone this repo and install from setup.py

    git clone https://github.com/fidyeates/PyHighcharts.git
    cd PyHighcharts
    git checkout dev
    sudo python setup.py install

## Whats New?

There are quite a few new features in PyHighcharts v2.0, we're attempting to bring stocks and maps into the forefront and allow customisation of charts in a less painful manner than previously.

These changes will be very breaking with the previous version of the code, so an upgrade will be in order.


## Design Overview

We wanted to make it as easy as possible to integrate highcharts with web-frameworks. We went back to the drawing board as to the best, pythonic, method of invoking this and came up with the following design pattern.

```python
from PyHighcharts import Chart, ChartTypes

# A chart is the container that your data will be rendered in, it can (obviously) support multiple data series within it.
chart = Chart()

# Adding a series requires a minimum of two arguments, the series type and an array of data points
chart.add_data_series(ChartTypes.Spline, [1, 2, 5, 4, 3], "Example Series")

# This will open up a browser window and display the chart on the page
chart.show()
```

We've also implemented the concept of templates, we've found while using the older version of PyHighcharts, we call the same code over and over again.

```python
for chart_data in lots_of_charts:
    chart = Chart()
    chart.set_options(...)
    chart.add_data_series(chart_data)
    # Do something with the chart here
```

In PyHighcharts v2.0 this can be reduced to:

```python
chart_template = Chart()
chart_template.set_options(...)
for chart_data in lots_of_charts:
    chart = chart_template.new()
    chart.add_data_series(chart_data)
    # Do something with the chart here
```

While the output would be identical with both invocations, the ability to create duplicates of charts with a single function call allows for pre-templating of charts and makes the maintenance of the visual side of the library much easier.

And you can always use the set options method:

```python
chart.set_options(yAxis={"title": {"text": "Quantity"}})
```

## Usage

```python
template = """
<body>
<div id="container"></div>
<script>
{}
</script>
</body>
"""
from pyhighcharts import Chart, ChartTypes
chart = Chart()
data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
chart.add_data_series(ChartTypes.line, data, name="Test")
template.format(chart.script())
```

## Todo:

* More Maps & Stocks work
* Cleaner code and some more helpful hooks
* Unittests
